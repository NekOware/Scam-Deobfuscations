This scam pretends like there's some timezone glitch to get free stuff from G2A while telling you to pay with bitcoin.

In reality this scam replaces the bitcoin wallet address and QR code shown into ones owned by the bad actor.

I've obtained this one from the following address

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KMb0fLkKHIC2qdjR4vCSRH9rVSjJVMdX/view

There is a copy of the pdf in this directory.

This pdf tells you to install tamper monkey and a script for it from the following address:

A copy of this script is in the `original.js` file in this directory.

My deobfuscated copy is in `deobfuscated.js` file also contained in this directory.
